            <h2>This project is named Delve Homes. We were tasked to make a promotional website to sell the underground living experience of a civilization living in subterranean communities. This project was based off of the book “The Machine Stops” by E.M. Forster. In this book we read about a civilization that is living underground in honeycomb shaped houses due to the surface being “Uninhabitable.”</h2>
            <h3>Using these softwares, I set out to create a website that would be cool and functional relating to the topic of the website. During the production of this website, my partner and I had to keep working through our struggles by communicating to each other how we wanted it to look and for what piece to go where. When we had problems, we had to investigate or determine what was wrong with the code. 
            </h3>

            <h4>We used several different softwares such as Lucidchart, Figma, Visual Studio Code, Github, Netlify, and Unsplash images. Lucidchart was used to create a flowchart of our website showing what would happen if a button was clicked. Basically, it would show the reaction of that action. Figma was used to create prototypes of our websites so we have an idea of what to make. Visual Studio Code was used to make the websites using code such as HTML and CSS. Github was used to host code and share the code from Visual Studio Code with our partner. Netlify is used to upload our websites. Finally, Unsplash images was just a software where one can find and use free images.</h4>

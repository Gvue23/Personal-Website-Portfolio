            <p>  This project is named the EECU Income Checkbook. We were assigned to make a website that would functional to the point where it can have a functional checkbook to record money deposits and withdrawals.
                We used several different softwares such as Lucidchart, Figma, Visual Studio Code, Github, Netlify, and Unsplash images. Lucidchart was used to create a flowchart of our website showing what would happen if something happened or something was clicked. Basically, it would show the reaction of that action. Figma was used to create prototypes of our websites so we have an idea of what to make. Visual Studio Code was used to make the websites using code such as HTML and CSS. Github was used to host code and share the code from Visual Studio Code with our partner. Netlify is used to upload our websites. Finally, Splash images was just a software where you can get free images.
                 Using these softwares, I set out to create a website that will have a functional checkbook register and has the visual aspects that would make it look casual and not out of the ordinary. In the development of this website, I had to persist through the challenges I encountered such as having the wrong code. When I had a hard time finding out what to input, I would ask my friends or people around me.</p>

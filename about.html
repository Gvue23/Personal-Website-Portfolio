        <h5>I love to do many things but my main passion is soccer. I play everyday with or without my team. I am currently playing for 2 teams. California Odyssey and Cal State Prep Academy. The Cal State Prep Academy team is currently playing at a semi-pro level so I am getting good experience playing with and against good competition. </h5>

        <h1>Secondary Plan</h1>
        <h2>After high school, I plan to go to college and play soccer there. Hopefully I get a scholarship or get picked up to play by a college. I don’t have a preferred college, so any college will do. My major will either be computer science or pharmacy. My dad wants me to be a pharmacist and my mom wants me to be a doctor but that is going to be hard. </h2>

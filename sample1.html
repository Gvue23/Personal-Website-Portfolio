            <p>  This writing sample is called the Career of Choice Research Essay. It is a research essay about choosing to become a Web Developer or Digital Designer as a future career. During this essay we had to choose a career and explain in multiple categories why it is a good choice to go into that field. We had to provide evidence on the career duties, work environment, important qualities, education/experience requirements, salaries, job outlook, and educational institution options. I selected this sample because it was a good and well written essay that provided enough information to help further prove my idea for the prompt. </p>

                <p>This writing sample is called the DelveHomes Reflective Essay. It is a reflective essay about how we thought we did during the production of our website and what our thoughts were after. This essay was all about explaining what process we went through to finish our project. What did we use and for what. I selected this sample because it was simple yet well explained about the process and it gives a little more insight to a project that I will be talking about. </p>

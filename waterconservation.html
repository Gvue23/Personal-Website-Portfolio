            <p>  This project is named Water Conservation. We were assigned to pick a social issue or current event that is a problem in our environment and make a website talking about how that is affecting us and the earth.  
                We used several different softwares such as Lucidchart, Figma, Visual Studio Code, Github, Netlify, and Unsplash images. Lucidchart was used to create a flowchart of our website showing what would happen if something happened or something was clicked. Basically, it would show the reaction of that action. Figma was used to create prototypes of our websites so we have an idea of what to make. Visual Studio Code was used to make the websites using code such as HTML and CSS. Github was used to host code and share the code from Visual Studio Code with our partner. Netlify is used to upload our websites. Finally, Unsplash images was just a software where you can get free images.
                    Using these softwares, I set out to create a website that would explain the topic I picked while also functioning correctly and displaying everything correctly. While making this website, I had to determine if what I was building was correct and correlated directly with the topic of this website while also being able to provide a functional and visually appealing website. Whenever I struggled and didn’t know what to do to fix my problem, I would ask a friend or I would ask the teacher.</p>

            <p>This project is named the Digital Board Game. We were assigned to create a board game but make it digital so it can be played on a computer or desktop. In this game, we had multiple functions. There was singleplayer and multiplayer which is self-explanatory about what it is. We had an instructions button that when clicked will provide you with instructions on how to play the game if you don’t know how to play. There was a credits button that would just display me and my partner’s names. Lastly, a statistics button was included that when clicked would display a table showing Player 1’s, Player 2’s, and the Bot’s wins, losses, ships destroyed, ships lost, average turns till you win, and win percentage. Also, there was a modification added to where it lets you add blocks to the map. You can add more blocks to make a bigger island and randomly place the island in different areas of the board. Changing the way it looks is possible too. This island made it so ships weren’t allowed to place their ships on it. The island would also appear on the opponent's board as well in the same spot. 
                We used several different softwares such as Lucidchart, Figma, VS Code, Github, Netlify, and Unsplash images. Lucidchart was used to create a flowchart of our website showing what would happen if something happened or something was clicked. Basically, it would show the reaction of that action. Figma was used to create prototypes of our websites so we have an idea of what to make. VS Code was used to make the websites using code such as HTML and CSS. Github was used to host code and share the code from Visual Studio Code with our partner. Netlify is used to upload our websites. Finally, Unsplash images was just a software where you can get free images. 
                    Using these softwares, I set out to create a fun game that is functional and is a little bit different than the original game by adding modifications. During the production of this website, I had to keep on trying different kinds of code to find out why my code isn't working. Determining what the problem was and how different pieces of code could change the result of my website were also things I encountered.
